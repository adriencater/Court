*Court is a simple web interface for creating PDF files with PrinceXML.*

Court lets you drag-and-drop your HTML, CSS, and JS files into a window; will feed that to PrinceXML, and give you a PDF file to download.

Basically, it's just a slick GUI for:

	cd ~/path/to/files

	prince -s style1.css -s style2.css input.xml -o output.pdf

Requires PHP, and PrinceXML.
